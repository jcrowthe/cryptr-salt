# Cryptr-Salt
Cryptr-salt is a secret store GUI built for secrets managed by SaltStack's [GPG renderer](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/renderers/all/salt.renderers.gpg.html). Using Salt's gpg renderer, you can securely save passwords, certificates, or other secrets on the salt master, where minions may request them as needed. This repo houses the front-end GUI to integrate with cryptr-server, which runs on a salt-master housing salt gpg-encrypted passwords. Using Cryptr-salt, a user may easily interact with the secrets in the saltstore, including reading and (eventually) modifying secrets easily.

Download Binaries
-----------------

Current release can be [downloaded from here](https://github.com/jcrowthe/cryptr/releases).
Cryptr-salt supports Windows, Linux and Mac OS. It has been tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop, and Mac OS 10.10 Yosemite.

On first run, Cryptr-salt prompts you for the url of cryptr-salt-server. If you haven't already set it up, you may do so [here](https://github.com/jcrowthe/cryptr-salt-server.git).


Status
------

Currently Cryptr-salt only allows read-only access to the salt secret storage. Write access is in progress.


Building from Source
-----------------

```
git clone https://github.com/jcrowthe/cryptr-salt.git
npm install
npm run build
```

This will run the npm 'build' script, which runs electron-packager. It will create a binary application for all distributions (Win/Mac/Linux) for both x32 and amd64. See electron-packager documentation for more info. Binaries are found in /dist.

NOTE: If building for the Windows platform on a non-windows machine, you will [need](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager#building-windows-apps-from-non-windows-platforms) to install Wine and node-rcedit. This is due to the custom app icon.
